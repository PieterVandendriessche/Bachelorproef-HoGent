The comparison is based on accessibility features for different kinds of disabilities such as vision, hearing or physically challenged users. A section on accessibility in mobile applications follows. According to a survey [1], the use of mobile platforms by people with disabilities is dramatically increasing. New accessibility features are introduced for each release of these platforms which makes them an affordable assistive technology.},
